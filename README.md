# changefiledate
Change the create/modify dates on all files in a folder (non-recursive) to a given date.

Create a Windows exe with pyinstaller and then copy it to /Programs (86)/changefiledate.exe to use this in Windows.
A pop-up box will request the folder to change by direct entry or using a folder browser. Press OK to select the folder.
A second pop-up box with a calendar can be used to set the new creation / modification dates on all files in the selected folder.
Press OK to start the process or cancel to stop the program.

Use the folder app to check the dates, if you want.
